# Code & Grow

## Overview 

Platform: Computer

Language: C# (Unity 2D)

Genre: Educational Simulation / Pet Progression

Art Style: Minimalist 2D cartoon

Title: Code & Grow

## Concept 

Concept: Code & Grow is a serious game that uses a combination of learning and playing to introduce players to Python programming. Players care for a baby panda, whose growth and happiness depend on them learning and applying coding concepts.

Knowledge acts as the panda’s 'food', with player progress directly linked to the pet’s emotional and physical development. The game promotes consistent, reflective and self-paced learning through positive reinforcement and interactive gameplay.

## MDA Framework

### Mechanics

Knowledge System: Three progressive levels introducing Python fundamentals.

- Level 1: Keywords & syntax (click, drag & drop).
- Level 2: Debugging & correction (multiple choice, fill-in).
- Level 3: Function writing & logic (short coding tasks).

Sleep & Code Cycle: Cooldowns simulate rest and spaced repetition.

Avatar Progression: Panda evolves from (Baby → Teen → Adult) to represent coding mastery.

Emotion System: Panda mood reflects learning activity (Happy → Sad).

Rewards: XP, outfits, and accessories for milestones.

### Dynamics

Responsibility Loop: The panda’s emotional health motivates players to keep learning.

Feedback Loop: Immediate visual and sound feedback reinforce correct answers.

Flow & Pacing: Short, distributed sessions promote sustainable learning habits.

Progression: Difficulty scales gradually, integrating previously learned concepts.


### Aesthetics

Sensation: Calm pastel visuals and soft background music.

Fantasy: Guide a panda to become a Python teacher.

Narrative: Follow the panda’s journey from student to mentor, fueled by knowledge.

Challenge: Gentle progression ensures engagement without frustration.

Discovery & Expression: Unlock Python topics and customize the panda’s appearance.

Submission: A relaxing loop that builds productive learning habits.
